Applying A star algorithm, we are trying to minimize time.

Heuristic function:  minimum_time = euclidean distance / max(speed_of_cycle, speed_of_bus)

Storing the parent value of a state in a dict - parent and then printing the path.

Code will run one by one on all the cases and can be extended for general input.
